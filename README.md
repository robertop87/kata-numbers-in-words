Hi everybody.

This is a partial result of a Coding Dojo made by Swissbytes guys.

We will try to add many languages if possible, for the moment we just have:

* Java (Maven project)
* C# (VS2015 project)
* Ruby (Plain text)

Rules: Randori.
Exercise: http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataNumbersInWords

Please use GIT branching model :)

Feel free to define a new date to resume it.

Happy coding!
